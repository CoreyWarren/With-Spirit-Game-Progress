# with-spirit-progress
"With Spirit!" is a video game I'm developing in Unity. 
I've been developing it for over 3 years at this point. But I still have much further to go!
I've decided to start keeping my code here both as a backup and as a way to show the progress I've made to myself and anyone else interested (potential employers, colleagues).
